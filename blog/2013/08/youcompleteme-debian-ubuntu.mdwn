[YouCompleteMe](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/) is a code completion
addon for Vim. It's one of my favorite addon for vim.

Many people have difficulties to install this addon with clang support. Also
this addon comes with their own boost libraries and llvm headers. I decided to
make a Debian package for easy installation and use it with system libraries.
Build system is patched in this package in order to use system libraries.

This package is **almost** lintian clean. Only problem is libclang is not
available in any system library directory and linker using RPATH. Debian will
not accept a package with [RpathIssue](http://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue).

*This addon requires libclang1-3.3 and libclang1-3.3-dev packages.
It's currently only available in Debian jessie/sid and Ubuntu saucy.*

Let's build YouCompleteMe for our system.

## Install required packages

This package needs following build dependencies:

 * git-buildpackage
 * pristine-tar
 * debhelper (>= 9)
 * dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~)
 * cmake
 * libpython-dev
 * libclang-3.3-dev
 * libboost-python1.53-dev
 * libboost-system1.53-dev
 * libboost-filesystem1.53-dev
 * libboost-regex1.53-dev
 * libboost-thread1.53-dev
 * vim-addon-manager


Install all build dependencies in one command:

    $ sudo apt-get install debhelper dpkg-dev cmake libpython-dev libclang-3.3-dev libboost-python1.53-dev libboost-system1.53-dev libboost-filesystem1.53-dev libboost-regex1.53-dev libboost-thread1.53-dev


## Clone our package repository with git-buildpackage

You can find package in <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/onur-guest/vim-youcompleteme.git;a=summary>.

Clone my repository with git-buildpackage:

    $ git://anonscm.debian.org/users/onur-guest/vim-youcompleteme.git


## Build package

Enter package directory first and run git-buildpackage command in this
directory. It will create orig.tar.gz and apply all patches.

    $ cd vim-youcompleteme
    $ git-buildpackage

## Install package and enable it with vam

Install debian package in top directory and enable YouCompleteMe with
vim-addon-manager.

    $ cd ../
    $ sudo dpkg -i vim-youcompleteme_20130727+ds1+gitf347885-1_amd64.deb
    $ vam install youcompleteme

And YouCompleteMe is ready. Happy coding :-)
